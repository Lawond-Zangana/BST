# BST
This project implements a binary search tree (BST) in Java, with functionality to insert, search, remove, and traverse nodes. The MyBST class allows key-value pairs to be stored in nodes, with various operations such as finding a node by its key and maintaining the structure of the tree during insertions and deletions. The MyBSTNode class represents individual nodes, containing references to left, right, and parent nodes. The BST supports common traversal operations (like in-order) and a method for copying the tree.
